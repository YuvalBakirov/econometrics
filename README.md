# Final Project:
<b>Econometrics is a quantitative measurement theory that uses statistical tools to examine relationships between economic variables, examine trends and provide economic forecasts.</b>

## About:
We learned basic knowledge regarding modern econometric tools that are used to test economic theories and models.<br>
We relyed on databases in order to examine economic theories from a variety of fields in the economy, such as labor economics, corporate governance, education economics and other topics in macro and micro economics.<br>
We discussed (1) <b>basic concepts in statistics<b>, (2) <b>regression of a single variable<b>, (3) <b>hypothesis testing<b>, <b>confidence intervals<b> and <b>prediction in models of a single explanatory variable<b>, (4) <b>multiple regression<b>, (5) <b>hypothesis tests and prediction in multiple regression variables<b>, (6)<b> specification problems<b>, (7) <b>covariates and interactions<b>, (8) <b>linear probability model<b>, (9)<b> panel data<b>, <b>the difference-in-differences model and models with fixed effects <b>(10) <b>heteroscedasticity <b>and ( 11)<b> Instrumental variables and simultaneous equations.<b><br>
The project combines imparting theoretical knowledge with practical analysis of data using R programming.
